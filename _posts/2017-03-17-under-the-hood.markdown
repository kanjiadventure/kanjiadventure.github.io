![New tiles!](/assets/images/new_tiles.jpg)

Time for an update! As you can see from the screenshot, we've made some progress on our tile assets and animations.

Most of the changes however took place under the hood. I have been doing quite a lot of refactoring, so code quality is much better now and allows for easy addition of new challenges and spells (which have up until this point been hardcoded). The game now remembers how well you do on each individual kanji character and thus gives the player kanji that they are worse at. Along with a couple bug fixes, we have changed the way the camera operates - it is now much smoother than it was in the January prototype.

Next week I will be starting work on overworld/out-of-battle experience, I cannot wait to share more progress!
