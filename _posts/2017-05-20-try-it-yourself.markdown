The day has finally come. You can now [download the exploration demo of Kanji Adventure][explore_showcase] and see the game in its current state for yourself.

After launching the game, press the "New game" button and an interactive tutorial will begin. As with the January build, you can refer to a cheatsheet located in the readme.md file should you struggle with hiragana.

Have fun with the build!
