Remember that monotonous grassy area where you used to wage war against all bunnykind over and over again? Boring, wasnâ€™t it? You will be happy to hear that the battles now take place in the same in-game area as the exploration portion of the game! Whenever you commence combat within the game, we will draw a boundary around your character that limits where you (and the enemies) are able to move. The game will also feature items that increase (or decrease) the size of the battlefield.
