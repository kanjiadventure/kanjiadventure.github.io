A belated Happy New Years to everyone! It has been one year since we've started our journey and to celebrate, we are releasing an up-to-date web build that contains the latest and greatest. You can access it on a [special website][html_build] we have set up for the occasion. We are also establishing our media presence by setting up a [Twitter feed][twitter], which will include behind the scenes tidbits about the development process, as well as [a page on Defold Community][def_community], an online hub dedicated to games made in the development tool we are using.

As for the game itself, we have a ton of stuff to get excited about, namely the addition of a second in-game area, completion of our harvesting and crafting interfaces, significant redesign of our main character, new spells and more! Enjoy the fresh new build and feel free to tell us what you think by reaching out to us in the Twitterverse! Stay tuned for more.
