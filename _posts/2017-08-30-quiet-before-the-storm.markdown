Reviving the journal to let you know about the new developments! Over the last two months we have been focusing on <s>procrastinating</s>, polishing the game, revamping the interface and working on a new crafting system as well as a second in-game area, currently dubbed the “Sand Island”. The focus of the gathering/crafting system is to allow the player to practice in a more relaxed environment and will have them matching kanji conjugations with kana transcriptions as well as English translations of the phrases.

Dave has also been hard at work creating a 3D version of our player character which will hopefully translate into improved animations (creating character animations in isometric perspective is hard, yo!)

In the meantime, have a wallpaper on us. :)
