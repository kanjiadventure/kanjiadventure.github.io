There have been some strange development on the Rabbit Island. Over the past week, its occupants started dropping fruit, flowers and even jewelry!

Each item falls into one of the following three categories:

* **Equipment** - these items modify various battle conditions, such as damage given, number of action and movement points and more. All items introduce one positive and one negative effect, so use them carefully!

* **Consumables** - potions, fruit and more... use these items in battle to replenish health

* **Resources** - these items do not possess any special abilities, but they can be used in quests or sold for profit
