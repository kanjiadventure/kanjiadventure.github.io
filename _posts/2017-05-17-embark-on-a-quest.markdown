The first seven quests are now part of the game. We have tried to make them as diverse as possible by introducing the following objectives:

* kill a number of enemies
* obtain a specified number of items
* find objects scattered around the map
* collect a number of kanji tablets (levels)
* talk to another NPC
* clear a number of battle challenges

The last week also saw introduction of vendors, redesigned exploration UI, and completion of the tutorial. Public build, the first since our battle prototype all the way back in January, will be dropping later this week!
