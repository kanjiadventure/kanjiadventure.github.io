After a battle-centric update, it is time to get back to the exploration mode. The newest update adds a brand new UI element that players might find useful, especially those of you who have gotten lost while exploring the Rabbit Island. Behold, the minimap!

Right now it shows your current location as well as locations of characters that want to have a word with you. In the future we plan to add locations of merchants, crafing stations and perhaps even gathering points that will be coming along in the crafting update. All of the functions of the minimap will also be accessible on a brand new map interface.
