We are in process of overhauling the battle maps, so that they no longer feature a single boring island floating in the sky (or rather black void). We figured that the best way to let you know that parts of the island are inaccessible is to transport them into an era long gone, when colour didn’t exist. That’s right, the no-go zone will be rendered in glorious greyscale! *#nofilter*

The effect is currently being tweaked and there are multiple new maps in the works that we think you are going to like. See you in a bit!
