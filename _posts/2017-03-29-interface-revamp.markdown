This week we have been busy coming up with concepts for KA's out-of-battle interface, which will include things like inventory, kanji encyclopaedia, quest log and more. We have also begun phasing out the temporary (and rather bland) design elements in favour of something a little more unified and professional looking. Here is a sneak preview of the new battle panel. Enjoy!
