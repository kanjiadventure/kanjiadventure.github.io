Over the past two weeks we have been hard at work designing the second in-game area and systems related to travel between the areas. While working on the second in-game area we have run into limitations stemming from the way our game interpreted input coordinates. We have reworked the routine and can now allow for maps with variable height, which will hopefully translate into more diverse environments. In addition to visual flair, we are coming up with game design implications, such as using the terrain height to limit movement and to block line of sight when using spells.

In other news, we have revamped the new player experience. The new tutorial looks neater, better adapts to the player's actions and helps explain new interfaces and mechanics that were not present in the exploration showcase back in May last year. In the screenshot below, you might notice that we have switched the boring font for something more livelier. We hope that the font appears less official, more upbeat and will hopefully help convey a more entertaining gameplay experience to our target audienceâ„¢.

Speaking of the user interface, we have added a way to rearrange the spell bar that is used in battle - the spellbook. In the very near future, we will introduce additional spells. As you acquire new spells, they will become unlocked in the spellbook, ready to be incorporated into your arsenal. We are currently discussing two methods of learning new spells - either via quests or from a so-called spell trainer in exchange for items and currency.
