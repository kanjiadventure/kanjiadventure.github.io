Another month, another update. We have finished the battle portion of the game and are now super busy implementing the whole out-of-battle bit. Over the past weeks we have been working on dynamic tile rendering, enemy mob generating procedures, communication between the battle and exploration portions of the game and of course, our first in-game location - the Rabbit Island. We have plenty of stuff to cover over the next couple weeks, stay tuned!

P.S. if you are interested in processes involving both game design and technical stuff behind the game, feel free to check out the thesis I am working on over on my [GitHub page][thesis] (will be WIP for another two weeks)
