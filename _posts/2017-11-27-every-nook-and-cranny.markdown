Just a quick update on the state of our current build. We have finally managed to fix our interface, so the game now displays correctly on resolutions other than 1920x1080. The battle system received a minor update in the form of enemy queues, the camera now also follows enemies during their turn. Probably the biggest change on the surface is the addition of a dedicated map interface that displays the entire game area along with points of interest. Highlighting an icon will display a tooltip that includes more information. Anyway, that’s it for the moment. Please enjoy a screenshot of the new map. Look closely and you might just notice what’s next!
